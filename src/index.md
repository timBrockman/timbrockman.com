##### Current Endeavors
###### Full Stack Developer



###### Masters of Science in Data Science

The University of Colorado Boulder officially accepted me into it's MS-DS program at the begining of 2023. I'm very proud to have be part of such an innovative and inclusive program. This really struck me when I recieved the official letter in the mail (along with some nice swag). This wasn't something that existed 5 or 10 years ago.

Thus far, most of the time spent in this program is working on coursework. On the side I'm doing some research into tracking stuff in space, and keeping up with the new NLP advancements.

##### Community Involvement


###### Open Source Contributions
Starting in early 2016, I began contributing to some of my favorite open source projects on GitHub. Lately I've been slacking on making any substantial contributions to good open source projects. Additionally, I've become a little paranoid about what I make available on platforms such as GitHub. Its important to help other developers so I'll try to do better.
- Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP): Contributed to early guidelines and worked on original templates for faster web performance.
- Kubernetes.io: Addressed Docker port assignment issues on MacOS in early versions of Docker.
