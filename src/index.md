##### Current Endeavors
As a Data Science student and Full Stack developer, I'm collecting better data and making it more opperational. Good data leads to new opportunities.

###### Full Stack Developer

My position at Katmai Government Services has been a great opportunity for growth and exploration. My role started with the goal to update some in-house line of business applications. Like many developers in small departments, your role quickly expands. You become the de facto cloud architect, database admin, DevSecOps, SRE, support tech, and whatever else could help the company.
I've been able to: 
 - Gain greater security awareness (and a lot of training)
 - Maintain a better focus on Accessibility
 - Work with a lot of people across the business's many contracts and companies
 - Build and admin a production Kubernetes cluster on bare metal using VMWare/vSphere for 6 years
 - Build and admin a GitLab Enterprise server for over 6 years
 - Build and admin Databases using SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL
 - Work with both Linux and Windows servers
 - Secure and update a critical PHP4 application not updated since 2003
 - Containerize some existing applications
 - Transition some parts of monolithic applications to microservice architecture
 - Build new GraphQL and Rest APIs
 - Build and secure applications and work with SAML, LDAP, OAuth, and JWTs
 - Build fast React interfaces with clever caching strategies
 - Update and refactor my code over the past 6 years as things change
 - Write tests and documentation
 - Wish I had written more tests and better documentation
 - Migrate from on-Safeguarding and other cloud services to Azure GCC High

###### Masters of Science in Data Science

The University of Colorado Boulder officially accepted me into it's MS-DS program at the beginning of 2023. I'm very proud to have be part of such an innovative and inclusive program. This really struck me when I received the official letter in the mail (along with some nice swag). This wasn't something that existed 5 or 10 years ago.

Thus far, most of the time spent in this program is working on coursework. On the side I'm doing some research into tracking stuff in space, and keeping up with the new NLP advancements.

##### Community Involvement


###### Open Source Contributions
Starting in early 2016, I began contributing to some of my favorite open source projects on GitHub. Lately I've been slacking on making any substantial contributions to good open source projects. Additionally, I've become a little paranoid about what I make available on platforms such as GitHub. Its important to help other developers so I'll try to do better.
- Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP): Contributed to early guidelines and worked on original templates for faster web performance.
- Kubernetes.io: Addressed Docker port assignment issues on MacOS in early versions of Docker.
