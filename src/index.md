##### Community Involvement


###### Open Source Contributions
Starting in early 2016, I began contributing to some of my favorite open source projects on GitHub. Lately I've been slacking on making any substantial contributions to good open source projects. Additionally, I've become a little paranoid about what I make available on platforms such as GitHub. Its important to help other developers so I'll try to do better.
- Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP): Contributed to early guidelines and worked on original templates for faster web performance.
- Kubernetes.io: Addressed Docker port assignment issues on MacOS in early versions of Docker.

###### Tech & Dev

I actively participate in Orlando's startup, tech community, and developer groups. You can find me regularly attending local Meetups, including:
- Orlando Devs
